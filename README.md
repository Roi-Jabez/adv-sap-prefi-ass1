## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages. Developers use SOA to reuse services in different systems or combine several independent services to perform complex tasks.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
Standardized Service Contracts - this service use service contracts  to express their purpose and their capabilities
Loose Coupling - This service it minimize dependencies on each other and create specific types of relationships within and outside of service boundaries with a constant emphasis on reducing dependencies between service contract
Abstraction - This Services hide the logic they encapsulate from the outside world.
Service Reusability - Logis is divided into services with the intent of maximizing reuse.
Autonomy - this services should have control over the logic they encapsulate and it represents the ability of a service to carry out its logic
Statelessness - it increase service scalability
Discoverability - the service can be discovered and it contain appropriate metadata for discovery which also communicates purpose and capabilities to humans.
3. Define Microservices.
an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Scalability  - because microservices allow individual components of an application to be scaled independently.
Flexibility and Agility - because microservices enable agility in development and deployment and it is valuable in fast paced development envionments.
Fault Isolation - Because microservice fails, it doesn't necessarily bring down the netire system
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
One of the similarities of SOA and Microservices is Service-Based because both of them are based on the idea of breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, and it is more manageable services

One of the differences of SOA and Microservices is Size and Granularity because one of the primary differences is the size and granularity of the service because SOA involves larger, coarser-grained services that encapsulate while microservices are smaller,fine-grained services that focus on specific business capabilities
